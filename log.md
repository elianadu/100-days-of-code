# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: Dec 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the HTML portion of The Odin Project (TOP) and browsed LeetCode!

**Thoughts** I'm pretty proud of what I've done today, although I'm worried I'm going to burn myself out. 1 hour a day seems like a lot to commit, but I'm determined to stick with it. I had a lot of fun making the recipe website!

### Day 2: Dec 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Up to the flexbox project on TOP!
**Thoughts** I think I should definitely slow down my pace; this feels a little unsustainable. But I had fun today! And I realize that earlier I was just skimming over the reading instead of playing with the code, which is why I became so confused by flexboxes. I'm excited for the final project tomorrow!
