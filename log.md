# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: Dec 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the HTML portion of The Odin Project (TOP) and browsed LeetCode!

**Thoughts**: I'm pretty proud of what I've done today, although I'm worried I'm going to burn myself out. 1 hour a day seems like a lot to commit, but I'm determined to stick with it. I had a lot of fun making the recipe website!

### Day 2: Dec 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Up to the flexbox project on TOP!

**Thoughts**: I think I should definitely slow down my pace; this feels a little unsustainable. But I had fun today! And I realize that earlier I was just skimming over the reading instead of playing with the code, which is why I became so confused by flexboxes. I'm excited for the final project tomorrow!

### Day 3: Dec 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished TOP's Landing Page project and installed Node.js!

**Thoughts**: Feeling a little tired, think I'm going to slow down a bit from this point. I think I was just very excited to get to Javascript. But I'm looking forward tomorrow and very happy with what I've done! Really proud of the landing page.

### Day 4: Dec 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Learned JS data types and conditionals!

**Thoughts**: Tired, slowing down a bit. I find myself impatient and skipping around to get to the parts I find more interesting, where the actual building happens. I think I should intentionally slow down. I'm just a little anxious about learning everything.

### Day 6: Dec 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented rock paper scissors activity and read about writing clean code.

**Thoughts**: So sleepy -- it's 4 a.m. and I completed my hour after getting back from New York. Perhaps this is a lesson learned about getting the hour of code done earlier in the day, before ambiguously-timed plans?

### Day 7: Dec 7, Sunday

### Day 9: Dec 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished exercises 06-11 in TOP's javascript-exercises repo for the Arrays + Loops sections. Moved onto DOM Manipulation and Events and finished the first exercise on the page!

### Day 10: Dec 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Read through first section of Assignment in DOM Manipulation + Events and tried some [basic DOM manipulation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/DOM_scripting#doing_some_basic_dom_manipulation).

**Thoughts**: Doing pretty well; excited to start the shopping list tomorrow. Still feel unsure about DOM manipulation, but hands-on practice should help. Bit stressed with finals.

### Day 11: Dec 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Feeling good! Worked on TOP shopping list and am working on updating the rock-paper-scissors project. 

**Thoughts**: I like that the instructions are getting more vague. It means I have to think for myself. Quite proud of myself for waking up today to do my hour of coding.

2. Started working on updating rock-paper-scissors UI with JS

### Day 12: Dec 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished rps-ui project and started etch-a-sketch project.

**Thoughts**: Happy with the progress I've made today! Was actually very fun. Was intimidated when I began the etch-a-sketch project, but it's going more smoothly than I thought it would! Note to future self: flex: 1 is a thing you can do. Also, [this Git tutorial](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) seems useful.

### Day 13: Dec 13, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished etch-a-sketch project!

**Thoughts**: Really enjoyed the etch-a-sketch project, although in my head I spent more time on this than I did in reality. Would someday like to go back and add more features, like colors and erasing, and make the UI more aesthetically pleasing. Feeling weirdly good about finals. Almost at the end of Foundations!

### Day 14: Dec 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Began learning object basics and completed a few exercises in the Assignments section.

**Thoughts**: Feeling good, albeit a little tired after my exam this morning! Proud of myself for doing my hour of coding despite considering skipping to study for tomorrow's exam. Reading the articles is never as interesting as actually working on a project, so I'm excited to apply this knowledge.

### Day 15: Dec 15, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some more array exercises and moved onto the JavaScript30 exercises. Working on 04.

**Thoughts**: I feel like I didn't get that much done. I'm spending more time on the Array exercises than I thought I would, especially in a whole hour. But I do feel myself getting more familiar with the methods, which is nice.

### Day 17: Dec 17, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Made it to last project of Foundations -- the calculator! Created the HTML, CSS, and JS files + started adding buttons and functions.

**Thoughts**: Happy about being on the last project, and quite enjoying it! Can feel myself getting comfortable with basic Git commands, which also makes me happy.

### Day 18: Dec 18, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on calculator

**Thoughts**: Didn't do that much work today and realizing it might have been cleaner if I wrote pseudocode. Not sure if I worked the whole hour; studied for ECE in the morning.

### Day 19: Dec 19, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished requirements for calculator project and made simple UI. 

**Thoughts**: Happy I finished Foundations! Dilly-dallied for some time. Getting functionality right was quite difficult. Not sure how to make it more organized though; struggled to break the task into discrete steps. Might come back to this to do the extra credit in the future and to just make it look nicer!

### Day 20: Dec 20, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through some of the Intermediate HTML + CSS content, up to "More Text Styles"

**Thoughts**: Honestly think I'm going to struggle through this section a bit. Seems quite boring, and there aren't many projects to motivate me through it.

### Day 21: Dec 21, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked up to the Sign-up Form project!

**Thoughts**: Feeling tired with the amount of documentation and lack of projects in this part of TOP, so I skipped and skimmed over some of the CSS readings. Not feeling great today, but have been watching The Good Place on the side as I've programmed.

### Day 25: Dec 25, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Admin Dashboard.

**Thoughts**: Wish I could have worked on this for more time today. Feeling a little unmotivated + find myself wanting to rush through to the next section, but a little more inspired by the poetry theme I've thought about, to make the project personal!
