# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: Dec 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the HTML portion of The Odin Project (TOP) and browsed LeetCode!

**Thoughts**: I'm pretty proud of what I've done today, although I'm worried I'm going to burn myself out. 1 hour a day seems like a lot to commit, but I'm determined to stick with it. I had a lot of fun making the recipe website!

### Day 2: Dec 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Up to the flexbox project on TOP!

**Thoughts**: I think I should definitely slow down my pace; this feels a little unsustainable. But I had fun today! And I realize that earlier I was just skimming over the reading instead of playing with the code, which is why I became so confused by flexboxes. I'm excited for the final project tomorrow!

### Day 3: Dec 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished TOP's Landing Page project and installed Node.js!

**Thoughts**: Feeling a little tired, think I'm going to slow down a bit from this point. I think I was just very excited to get to Javascript. But I'm looking forward tomorrow and very happy with what I've done! Really proud of the landing page.

### Day 4: Dec 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Learned JS data types and conditionals!

**Thoughts**: Tired, slowing down a bit. I find myself impatient and skipping around to get to the parts I find more interesting, where the actual building happens. I think I should intentionally slow down. I'm just a little anxious about learning everything.

### Day 6: Dec 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented rock paper scissors activity and read about writing clean code.

**Thoughts**: So sleepy -- it's 4 a.m. and I completed my hour after getting back from New York. Perhaps this is a lesson learned about getting the hour of code done earlier in the day, before ambiguously-timed plans?

### Day 7: Dec 7, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked up to exercises for Arrays and Loops portion of TOP.

### Day 9: Dec 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished exercises 06-11 in TOP's javascript-exercises repo for the Arrays + Loops sections. Moved onto DOM Manipulation and Events and finished the first exercise on the page!

**Thoughts**: Feeling good! Taking it slower now, especially during finals week. A little stressed about other work to be done, but finding TOP to be quite relaxing.

### Day 10: Dec 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Read through first section of Assignment in DOM Manipulation + Events and tried some [basic DOM manipulation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/DOM_scripting#doing_some_basic_dom_manipulation).

**Thoughts**: Doing pretty well; excited to start the shopping list tomorrow. Still feel unsure about DOM manipulation, but hands-on practice should help. Bit stressed with finals.

### Day 11: Dec 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Feeling good! Worked on TOP shopping list and am working on updating the rock-paper-scissors project. 

**Thoughts**: I like that the instructions are getting more vague. It means I have to think for myself. Quite proud of myself for waking up today to do my hour of coding.

2. Started working on updating rock-paper-scissors UI with JS

### Day 12: Dec 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished rps-ui project and started etch-a-sketch project.

**Thoughts**: Happy with the progress I've made today! Was actually very fun. Was intimidated when I began the etch-a-sketch project, but it's going more smoothly than I thought it would! Note to future self: flex: 1 is a thing you can do. Also, [this Git tutorial](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) seems useful.

### Day 13: Dec 13, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished etch-a-sketch project!

**Thoughts**: Really enjoyed the etch-a-sketch project, although in my head I spent more time on this than I did in reality. Would someday like to go back and add more features, like colors and erasing, and make the UI more aesthetically pleasing. Feeling weirdly good about finals. Almost at the end of Foundations!

### Day 14: Dec 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Began learning object basics and completed a few exercises in the Assignments section.

**Thoughts**: Feeling good, albeit a little tired after my exam this morning! Proud of myself for doing my hour of coding despite considering skipping to study for tomorrow's exam. Reading the articles is never as interesting as actually working on a project, so I'm excited to apply this knowledge.

### Day 15: Dec 15, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some more array exercises and moved onto the JavaScript30 exercises. Working on 04.

**Thoughts**: I feel like I didn't get that much done. I'm spending more time on the Array exercises than I thought I would, especially in a whole hour. But I do feel myself getting more familiar with the methods, which is nice.

### Day 17: Dec 17, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Made it to last project of Foundations -- the calculator! Created the HTML, CSS, and JS files + started adding buttons and functions.

**Thoughts**: Happy about being on the last project, and quite enjoying it! Can feel myself getting comfortable with basic Git commands, which also makes me happy.

### Day 18: Dec 18, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on calculator

**Thoughts**: Didn't do that much work today and realizing it might have been cleaner if I wrote pseudocode. Not sure if I worked the whole hour; studied for ECE in the morning.

### Day 19: Dec 19, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished requirements for calculator project and made simple UI. 

**Thoughts**: Happy I finished Foundations! Dilly-dallied for some time. Getting functionality right was quite difficult. Not sure how to make it more organized though; struggled to break the task into discrete steps. Might come back to this to do the extra credit in the future and to just make it look nicer!

### Day 20: Dec 20, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through some of the Intermediate HTML + CSS content, up to "More Text Styles"

**Thoughts**: Honestly think I'm going to struggle through this section a bit. Seems quite boring, and there aren't many projects to motivate me through it.

### Day 21: Dec 21, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked up to the Sign-up Form project!

**Thoughts**: Feeling tired with the amount of documentation and lack of projects in this part of TOP, so I skipped and skimmed over some of the CSS readings. Not feeling great today, but have been watching The Good Place on the side as I've programmed.

### Day 22: Dec 22, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Sign-up Form project and started learning about CSS Grid.

**Thoughts**: Still feeling a bit tired and unmotivated, but we'll see where things go!

### Day 23: Dec 23, Tuesday

### Day 24: Dec 24, Wednesday

### Day 25: Dec 25, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Admin Dashboard.

**Thoughts**: Wish I could have worked on this for more time today. Feeling a little unmotivated + find myself wanting to rush through to the next section, but a little more inspired by the poetry theme I've thought about, to make the project personal!

### Day 26: Dec 26, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Admin Dashboard!!! Started the Javascript Course!!

**Thoughts**: It's past 4 am right now -- I've been working on this for the past 4 and a half hours, but the time passed by quickly. I'm happy with the end result (although it still has some janky behavior I can't explain), especially because I did something creative. I should learn to commit more often, though, and pull before I work. I keep finding myself committing at the very end of the project after it's done, which defeats the purpose of commits. I'm so excited to start with Javascript (although the docs will undoubtedly be boring) and I cannot wait to pass out in a few minutes.

### Day 27: Dec 27, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Library project, worked up to Tic-Tac-Toe.

**Thoughts**: I didn't realize how much progress I made today. I came to the log feeling a little disappointed by the amount of work I did, but I made good progress. The course is long, and I'm at a point wondering if I need this depth of knowledge, or if I should skip ahead, because there's little chance I'm going to make as much progress as I want to over winter break. But I'll stay the path. Hopefully will finish Tic-Tac-Toe tomorrow morning and (in an ideal world) can get to the Restaurant Page!

### Day 28: Dec 28, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Tic-Tac-Toe.

**Thoughts**: Wow. Tic-Tac-Toe took so much longer than I thought it would. Proud of myself, but the end result still isn't as aesthetically pleasing as I hoped it would be. I think it's a better use of my time to move on though. Hopefully will get to the restaurant project tomorrow. Chances of finishing the course by the end of break seem slimmer and slimmer.

### Day 29: Dec 29, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started on Restaurant project!

**Thoughts**: Will ideally finish to-do list project tomorrow. Will probably deploy barebones restaurant project and come back to style later if I do choose. Feeling good. Can't believe it's almost been a month.

### Day 30: Dec 30, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished restaurant project, learned about OOP best principles (SOLID), started to-do list.

**Thoughts**: Logging this a day late. Feeling tired, will work on LeetCode a little bit. Feeling like I should look for summer opportunities.

### Day 33: Jan 2, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on todo list -- got projects working but want to work on editing todos tomorrow!

**Thoughts**: Got a little tired and finding this a little frustrating. Struggling with organizing my code, but hopefully this is something I'll get better at.

### Day 35: Jan 4, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Did my hour on the car ride to VT. Worked on editing todos and displaying things in the right way, especially with edge cases (like when all projects have been deleted).

**Thoughts**: Feeling good! Just have to do some UI stuff -- hoping to be done tomorrow (🤞)? The code structure is so janky -- there are so many times I've thought about deleting everything and starting again.

### Day 36: Jan 5, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Essentially finished the Todo list (did date formatting and minor style fixes), but want to add responsive menu button for the project sidebar and adjust styling a little. 

**Thoughts**: Asked ChatGPT for a lot of help -- feeling unmotivated and tired. Feeling stressed about the summer, about the future. Want to just read.

### Day 37: Jan 6, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished todo project!

**Thoughts**: Asked Chat for lots of help again -- still feeling unmotivated. Still uncertain about the future, and generally tired after the long days.

### Day 38: Jan 7, Wednesday

### Day 39: Jan 8, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on [LeetCode Top 150](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/) and kept working through form validation on TOP.

**Thoughts**: Still tired, didn't really want to do TOP. Form validation is harder than I thought it would. Called a career advisor this morning and felt overwhelmed by how much it feels like there is to do. Might start logging LeetCode solns in a repo.

### Day 39: Jan 8, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished form validation and reading about asynchronous code on TOP.
