# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: Dec 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the HTML portion of The Odin Project (TOP) and browsed LeetCode!

**Thoughts** I'm pretty proud of what I've done today, although I'm worried I'm going to burn myself out. 1 hour a day seems like a lot to commit, but I'm determined to stick with it. I had a lot of fun making the recipe website!

### Day 2: Dec 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Up to the flexbox project on TOP!

**Thoughts** I think I should definitely slow down my pace; this feels a little unsustainable. But I had fun today! And I realize that earlier I was just skimming over the reading instead of playing with the code, which is why I became so confused by flexboxes. I'm excited for the final project tomorrow!

### Day 3: Dec 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished TOP's Landing Page project and installed Node.js!

**Thoughts** Feeling a little tired, think I'm going to slow down a bit from this point. I think I was just very excited to get to Javascript. But I'm looking forward tomorrow and very happy with what I've done! Really proud of the landing page.

### Day 4: Dec 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Learned JS data types and conditionals!

**Thoughts** Tired, slowing down a bit. I find myself impatient and skipping around to get to the parts I find more interesting, where the actual building happens. I think I should intentionally slow down. I'm just a little anxious about learning everything.

### Day 6: Dec 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented rock paper scissors activity and read about writing clean code.

**Thoughts** So sleepy -- it's 4 a.m. and I completed my hour after getting back from New York. Perhaps this is a lesson learned about getting the hour of code done earlier in the day, before ambiguously-timed plans?
